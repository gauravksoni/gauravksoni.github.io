        <h4 id="hooktop">Crane Hook</h4>
        <p>A lifting hook is a device for grabbing and lifting loads by means of a device such as a hoist or crane.
            A lifting hook is usually equipped with a safety latch to prevent the disengagement of the lifting wire rope sling,
            chain or rope to which the load is attached.A hook may have one or more built-in pulleys to amplify the lifting force.</p>

        <h4 id="gptop">Geneva Plate</h4>
        <p>The Geneva drive or Maltese cross is a gear mechanism that translates a continuous rotation into an intermittent rotary motion.
            The rotating drive wheel has a pin that reaches into a slot of the driven wheel advancing it by one step.
            The drive wheel also has a raised circular blocking disc that locks the driven wheel in position between steps.</p>

        <h4 id="gastop">Gasket</h4>
        <p>TA gasket is a mechanical seal which fills the space between two or more mating surfaces, generally to prevent leakage
            from or into the joined objects while under compression. Gaskets allow "less-than-perfect" mating surfaces on machine parts where
            they can fill irregularities. Gaskets are commonly produced by cutting from sheet materials.
            Gaskets for specific applications, such as high pressure steam systems, may contain asbestos.
            However, due to health hazards associated with asbestos exposure, non-asbestos gasket materials are used when practical.
            It is usually desirable that the gasket be made from a material that is to some degree yielding such that it is able to
            deform and tightly fills the space it is designed for, including any slight irregularities.
            A few gaskets require an application of sealant directly to the gasket surface to function properly.</p>

        <h4 id="iptop">Idler Plate</h4>
        <p>This is the Idler Pulley Plate. It can be used with both V- Slot and Open Rail.
            The idea behind this plate is to give you a mountable yet movable plate for your Smooth Idler Pulley.
            This works great as it allows you to easily tension your belt.
            There are a lot of possible mounting configurations for this plate.</p>

        <h4 id="armtop">Rocker Arm</h4>
        <p>A rocker arm is an oscillating lever that conveys radial movement from the cam lobe into linear movement
            at the poppet valve to open it. One end is raised and lowered by a rotating lobe of the camshaft
            (either directly or via a tappet (lifter) and pushrod) while the other end acts on the valve stem.
            When the camshaft lobe raises the outside of the arm, the inside presses down on the valve stem, opening the valve.
            When the outside of the arm is permitted to return due to the camshafts rotation, the inside rises, allowing the valve
            spring to close the valve.</p>

        <h4 id="steeltop">Steel Bracket</h4>
        <p>Brackets can support many architectural items, including a wall, balcony, parapets, eaves, the spring of an arch,
            beams, pergola roof, window box, or a shelf. In adjustable shelving systems, the bracket may be in two parts,
            with the load- bearing horizontal support fitting into a wall-mounted slotted vertical metal strip.
            Brackets also are an element in the systems used to mount modern facade cladding systems onto the outside of
            contemporary buildings, as well as interior panels.</p>
